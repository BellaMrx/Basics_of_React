## 1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook and contains a basic framework for the output of user interface components for websites. The components have a hierarchical structure and can be displayed as a separate HTML tag. React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where all necessary changes can be made instead of changing the DOM of the web browser directly. React is therefore an ideal basis for single-page applications (SPA).

SPAs are web applications that consist of just one HTML document and an associated JavaScript file, the content of which is loaded dynamically. This means that no additional page call for further files is necessary, but the higher-level JavaScript on the client side is used to render the new view. Classic web applications usually consist of several HTML documents that are linked to each other. When the website is changed, communication with the server must be repeated. If there are many requests from visitors, this places a heavy load on the server.

With SPAs, client-side performance is increased and the server is relieved. The reduced client-server communication reduces the waiting time for users enormously. Depending on the application, it can also be navigated offline once the page has been loaded and the data has been cached in the web browser's web storage. SPAs are well suited for web applications with a high number of visitors in order to reduce the load on the server.

An SPA is actually just JavaScript that is managed in folders and files. React offers the necessary tools for this. React places few requirements on the environment to be executed, which is why the library is very flexible and is also often used for individual interactive parts of websites. The use of React is worthwhile if you have a user interface with a lot of interactions in which the state is constantly changing.


## 2. Prepare the use of React
To use React, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and npm must first be installed. As a rule, it should already be installed if you have already worked with JavaScript. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that can execute JavaScript outside the web browser. You can also find a short guide here [GitHub - BellaMrx](https://github.com/BellaMrx/WebDevelopment_Basics#11-use-javascript-on-the-server-side---nodejs).

You can check whether Node.js and npm are already installed in the terminal with :

   ```
    $ node --version
    $ npm --version
   ```
When a version is displayed, you can start using React. Alternatively, the online editor [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) can also be used to learn and test React.
